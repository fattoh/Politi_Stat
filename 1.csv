Raddatz, eventually died earlier this year, his sister said that his death came while waiting for a second procedure that did not happen because the transplant donor unexpectedly fell ill.

3,"If Congress doesn’t avoid the sequester, ""tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids.""","The sequester does hit two big programs that affect parents’ child care or their need for it — a subsidy program and the early childhood education program Head Start. The government estimates up to 100,000 kids would be affected. But neither the White House nor HHS (Department of Health and Human Services ) has provided sufficient evidence to establish the number of kids whose parents would need to find other child care.

5,Undocumented workers pay more than Trump in federal income taxes,"While there is no official figure, experts estimate that about half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, if not more. So in a year when Trump does not pay federal income taxes, which has been the case in the past, undocumented immigrants who do federal pay income taxes would pay more than him.
But Clinton makes it seem as if this is a present state, and we don’t know anything about Trump’s current tax situation because he has not made his tax returns public. For that reason, we have no way of comparing Trump’s federal income tax payments to those of any given undocumented immigrant."
6,The unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent.,"Trump keeps repeating that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. But getting a percentage that high requires believing that being a high school, college or graduate student, a senior citizen, a stay-at-home parent, a job-training participant, or having a disability is no excuse for not holding down a job, or for working less than 40 hours in a week. The highest alternative unemployment-rate measure we could come up with that had any credibility was 16.4 percent, and even that exaggerated figure is only about one-third of the way to Trump’s 42 percent."
7,Edward Snowden could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower.,"A key 1998 law focused on intelligence community workers does lay out a pathway Snowden could have followed. However, there is at least a significant legal debate over whether the issues Snowden wanted to raise would fall under that law.
Additionally, legal experts including an Army inspector general have said that the 1998 law does not protect whistleblowers from reprisals.
The protections that Clinton referenced do not seem to be as strong as she suggested, and most of the expert opinion suggests they would not apply to Snowden."
8,The media distortedwhat happened with a baby at my rally.,"Many media outlets reported that Trump ""threw out"" or ""ejected"" a crying baby from a campaign event in Virginia, based on his commentary on the incident.

9,"Trump’s post said, ""Hypocrisy at the Clinton Foundation: Top male staff made on average $218,029 while top female staff made $153,014 from 2010-2014.""",The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.
10,My mother had to fight with health insurance companies for treatment because of a pre-existing condition., A biography of Obama's mother and additional reporting by the New York Times have shown that a key point that Obama's mother was fighting not for treatment but for payments from a disability insurance policy. 
11,"They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements.",Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
12,Civilian deaths and bombings are down in Iraq.,"According to a report from the Defense Department based on information from coalition forces and the Iraqi government, civilian deaths in Iraq ranged from 600 in January 2008 up to 950 in April. The number of civilian deaths in early 2009 have been markedly lower: 270 in January, 230 in February and 260 in March. That's dramatically lower than late 2006 and early 2007, when civilian deaths were about 3,500 a month."
13,During the two past years the taxes were being decreased.,"Obama has raised taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning, and the health care law includes a tax penalty on the uninsured.

Obama kicked off his tax cuts for workers with the economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. He asked for tax cuts of $500 per worker per year; Congress agreed to $400.

14,Four billion dollars of tax increasing is proposed during Tim Kaine first week as governer.,"Kaine, six days after taking office in 2006, did propose a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Trump calls it a ""nearly $4 billion tax increase,"" citing a figure used in a newspaper article at the time. But the article said that sum would be realized over four years. Trump, in using that high $4 billion figure, omits the clarifying time span.
The tax package centered on raising levies on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. It would have affected people with taxable incomes of $17,000 or lower - if they had a car."
15,No one of the seventeens republican nominees has discussed how they would address the rising cost of college.,"Republican senator Marco Rubio has been talking about the issue since at least February 2014, when he made a major policy speech about controlling crippling college debt. He repeated his positions in a July speech after he declared his candidacy."
16,"If Congress doesn’t avoid the sequester, ""tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids.""","""tens of thousands"" is plausible, but unproven"
17,"Insurers delayed an Illinois man's treatment, ""and he died because of it.""","Otto S. Raddatz, didn’t die because the insurance company rescinded his coverage once he became ill, an act known as rescission.  An efforts got Mr. Raddatz’s policy reinstated within three weeks of his April 2005 rescission and secured a life-extending stem-cell transplant for him. Mr. Raddatz died nearly four years after the insurance showdown."
18,Around one thousand dollars as a reasonable estimate for uninsured costs.,"Clinton’s point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that she’s at least close. "
19,"""I will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment.

But Obama used the anecdote to make a case for a significant change in the law that affected the national health care system. We find a report and a New York Times story to be compelling evidence that he got a crucial detail wrong, and the White House did not dispute that. His mother was fighting for insurance payments as she was dying, but for disability insurance, not health insurance, as her son said he remembered."
20,I lowered taxes over the last two years.,A majority of Americans have seen reduced taxes under President Obama. But he's also taken steps to increase a few taxes like cigarettes and tanning over the past two years.
21,Clinton Foundation pays top women less than top men,"If you allow some leeway on what accounts for top staff, Trump is close on the numbers. But the statistical pool is too limited and the methodology is too crude to demonstrate evidence of hypocrisy. Trump is guilty of ignoring the nuances of gender-based wage disparities, just as Democrats often over-simplify."
22,"In Iraq, ""civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, etc., remain very low relative to what was going on last year 2008.",According to the Defense Department and other sources to see if Obama was correct about declining rates of civilian deaths and bombings. The short answer is that he is.
23,"Trump says they were going to build a fence in 2006, but environmental rules got in the way.","The Secure Fence Act of 2006 called for the construction of an additional 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. While there were environmental concerns related to the construction, the Secretary of Homeland Security waived required environmental reviews in order to proceed with construction.
Trump’s statement suggests a wall or barrier was not built due to inability to get environmental impact statements."
24,"Every family health insurance policy has ""a $900 hidden tax"" to subsidize health care costs of the uninsured.","According to the Kenneth E. Thorpe's analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270. There are also other health policy experts agreed with here and the mentioned value amount was close."
25,One of the largest Muslim countries is USA,Obama is trying to make a point that the United States is in touch with the Muslim world because it has a substantial Muslim population. But he dramatically overreaches by saying the United States would be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Ranking 58 out of the world's 60 most populous Muslim nations does not a large Muslim country make. 
26,"Clinton about Obama ""basically threatened to bomb Pakistan.""",Obama's Speech about this subject makes it clear that he is talking about targeting terrorists within the country regardless of whether he has the permission of the Pakistani government.

30,Undocumented workers pay more than Trump in federal income taxes,"""That makes me smart,"" Trump said at the first debate when Clinton suggested he didn't pay federal taxes.
Undocumented immigrants, on the other hand, pay billions in taxes.
